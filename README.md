# invest-portfolio-analysis
Several projects are showing analytical skills for managing customer portfolios and using Modern Portfolio Theory, work about which was published by Harry Markowitz in his paper "Portfolio Selection" in the Journal of Finance in 1952.

In every project we have customer portfolio consisting of 13 shares.
## List projects
- [__invest-portfolio-analysis-cvxopt__](invest-portfolio-analysis-cvxopt.ipynb): In this project we implement mean-variance analysis by using quadratic cone program solver from the CVXOPT library.
- [__invest-portfolio-analysis-scipy-target__](invest-portfolio-analysis-scipy-target.ipynb): In this project we achieve target return by using weight optimization from the scipy library.
- [__invest-portfolio-analysis-scipy-sharp__](invest-portfolio-analysis-scipy-sharp.ipynb): In this project we achieve the optimized value of the Sharp Ratio by using weight optimization from the scipy library.
- [__invest-portfolio-analysis-random-sharp__](invest-portfolio-analysis-random-sharp.ipynb): In this project we choose portfolio with max Sharpe Ratio from random generated portfolios.
- [__invest-portfolio-analysis-pyportfolioopt__](invest-portfolio-analysis-pyportfolioopt.ipynb): In this project we implement mean-variance analysis by using PyPortfolioOpt library to build random portfolios and Efficient Frontier.
